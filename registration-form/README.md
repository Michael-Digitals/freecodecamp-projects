# Registration Form
Challenges:
I got stuck trying to pass my code at step 29. I didn't link the input and the label elements using the "id" & "for" attributes respectively. I spent over 2 minutes trying to figure this out, until I read the instruction again. // Lesson: Always read the instructions carefully.
Help: Can anyone explain the accessiblity the "id" and "for" attributes allows when included in the label and input elements respectively?
