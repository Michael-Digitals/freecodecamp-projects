# Registration Form
This form is created to collect information from people who visit my webpage.
Achievments:
1. I learnt how to control the types of data users can type into my form.
2. I also learnt new CSS tools (like)

Challenges:
1. I got stuck trying to pass my code at step 29. I didn't link the input and the label elements using the "id" & "for" attributes respectively. I spent over 2 minutes trying to figure this out, until I read the instruction again. // Lesson: Always read the instructions carefully.
2. Imagine just a single "s" preventing my code from passing!


Help: Can anyone explain the accessiblity the "id" and "for" attributes allows when included in the label and input elements respectively?
